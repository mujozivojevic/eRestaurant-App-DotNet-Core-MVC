Descriptions:

In this project I made web app for administration staff of restaurant with Asp .Net Core MVC .

First I made a database with CODE FIRST approach where i made models in Visual Studio. Then I used migrations for deploy database to
SQL server.

I made AREAS for Administration for better schedule of code. If app need upgrades (example for Customer), just add new AREAS.

I took free template from this site https://colorlib.com/wp/free-bootstrap-admin-dashboard-templates/ , then modified for my purpose.

For all of these features I made CRUD operation ( Adding, reading, update, delete - food, orders, employees etc...)

Features:

 - Login
 
 - Menu(food)
 
 - Orders
 
 - Reservations
 
 - Notifications for clients(restaurant guest)
 
 - Employee records( arrivals and leaves)
 
 - List of employees 
 
 - Employees paymant
